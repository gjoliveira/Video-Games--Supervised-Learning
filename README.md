# Video-Games--Supervised-Learning
Exploratory data analysis and supervised learning models for classification

The project involves the exploratory data analysis and application of "Supervised Learning" models with the aim of predicting evaluations (good, great, medium, bad, etc.) made by users of diferent specific games. I analyzed a dataset containing approximately 6000 video games.

The work is divided into the following stages:
  -  Preprocessing and data analysis (removing irrelevant columns from our dataset, searching for outliers, categorizing numerical variables, etc.);
  -  Test/Train dataset split
  -  Development and improvement of classification models (Decision Tree Classifiers, K-NN);
  -  Testing the efficiency of our learning models;
